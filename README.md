# Uber Data Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an analysis of Uber ride data and includes a prediction model. The notebook explores various aspects of the data, performs data preprocessing, conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), and builds a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis and prediction is available in the `data` directory. It includes information such as start and end dates, categories, start and stop locations, miles travelled, and the purpose of the ride.

## Notebook Content

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository includes the following sections:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Prediction of Uber ride attributes

## Dependencies

To run the notebook and reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are required:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the `Dependencies` section.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`uber_data_analysis_prediction.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Execute the cells in sequential order to reproduce the analysis and prediction.
